Project A:   Dynamic Calculator

Prompt
	You’re a lazy math student.  Write a program that does your work for you.

Your project will contain these items:
	Operation objects:
		Properties:
			Name: a string that describes what the operation does
			Args: the number of arguments this operation takes
		Methods:
			Operation: a function that does the math 
				args: variable - up to you
				returns: the result of the math you made it do
				behavior: it executes the formula indicated in the 'name' property
	Dynamic calculator function:
		Arguments:
			op: An operation object
			a, b, c:  Numbers to be operated on. Each operation object will use as many of them as it needs. 
		Return values:
			A number:  The result of sending the arguments through op.operation().
		Behavior:
			DynCalc will pass (a), (a,b), or (a,b,c) into ‘op.operation’’ depending on the value of ‘op.args’ and return the value of the function call.

Usage example:
	var result = dynCalc(add, 3, 4);
	
Challenge: 
	Give the dynCalc a property called ‘operations’ which is an object of operation objects.  Next give the calculator a method that adds new operations objects to the ‘dynCalc.operations’ object.

Sample inputs and outputs:
	: {name: 'subtract', args: 2, operation: function(a, b){return a - b}}, 4, 2
		//->  2
	: {name: 'square', args: 1, operation: function(a){return a * a}}, 6, 7 
		//->  36
	: {name: 'sum3', args: 3, operation: function(a, b, c){return a + b + c}}, 1, 2
		//->  NaN
