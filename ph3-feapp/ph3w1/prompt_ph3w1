here we have the project from last week, but with a front-end app integrated.

the front-end app -
will use AJAX 
will have it's own set of router files

this will be enough work to get working well

challenge
write a 'full' front-end back-end with proxies for all app components that only updates to synch its db to the backend one. (its db will deal with the same schema as your real backend) 
how to manage different users accessing the same data at the same time?

there will be a shadow copy of your project (file structure and all) that consists of api's only
