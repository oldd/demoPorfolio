Project:   Beaver Browser

Prompt
	Beavers are sick of you.  they stole your laptop and now all use your tracking software as a Facebook For Beavers (tm)
	(i recommend ctr-c ctr-v your last project into a new folder and modifying it to create this project)

Your project will contain these items:	
	BEAVERS.HTML:  the home page with all profiles listed

	PROFILE.HTML:  the beaver's individual profile

	STYLES FOlDER:  a folder with all of your styles
	
	SCRIPTS FILE:
		CONTROLLER.JS:  as before, manipulates models and views.  
		MODELS FOLDER:
			BEAVERMODEL.JS:  the model object that manipulates beaver objects
			RELATIONSMODEL.JS:  the model object that manipulates relationship objects
		VIEWS FOLDER:
			BEAVERSVIEW.JS:  the model object that controls beavers.html
			PROFILEVIEW.JS:  the model object that controls profile.html
	

Some User Stories:
	- a beaver opens the site, clicks on their profile, adds a friend and waits to hear back
	- a beaver views Patty's profile to see if she is friends with Willard
	...

The exercises it combines:
