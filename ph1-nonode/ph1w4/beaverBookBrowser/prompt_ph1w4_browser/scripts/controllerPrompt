this will be a huge object.  find a way you like to make this more manageable. maybe by giving controller several property objects. (Guillermo, this will be part of the final assignment.  to organize this in some way, but without guidance)


FUNCTIONALITIES:  everything from the previous project plus ...
	PROFILE PAGE: a handler for each functionality needed on the profile page that can't be completed using a handler from last project
	LAST SELECTED:  store a property that remembers the last beaver clicked.  this will be helpful when navigating to a beaver's profile or sending a friend request.
	RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT:  you will need to 'duplicate' the beaver-based handlers so you can handle relationship objects
	NAVIGATION:  handlers that manage going from home->profile, profile->home, profile->profile.
